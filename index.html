  <h1> Jonathan Ortiz </h1>
  <p> <em>System Engineer at <strong><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> </strong> </em> </p>
  <p> Project Manager with more than ten years of experience in the IT field.

    During my career, I have acquired knowledge and skills in the development process since I have been involved in it end-to-end from the requirement gathering to the go-live.

    In the last five years, I have been part of several teams mainly in management roles staring first as QA Lead, then Scrum Master and finally becoming in a Project Manager for several accounts.

    As part of my management task on each account, I have always helped teams on reaching the deliveryâ€™s goals with focus on quality and always in a timely miner.

    I consider myself a very proactive and enthusiastic person that is always looking
    forward to improve the development process and deliverables along whit keeping the team member motivated and contained.

    Due to my technical background in System Engineering, I have a deep
    understanding of technologies and that helps me to get along with both technical and non-technical people.
